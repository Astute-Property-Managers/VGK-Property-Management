### 13. General Ledger

**Purpose**: Complete audit trail of all transactions. Foundation of double-entry bookkeeping.

#### Understanding the Ledger

Every financial transaction creates **two entries**:
- **Debit** (left side): Increases Assets/Expenses, Decreases Liabilities/Income/Equity
- **Credit** (right side): Decreases Assets/Expenses, Increases Liabilities/Income/Equity

**Example: Tenant Pays Rent (UGX 500,000)**:
- **Debit**: Cash at Bank (1000) +500,000 → Asset increases
- **Credit**: Rental Income (4000) +500,000 → Income increases
- **Result**: Debits = Credits (balanced)

#### Viewing Transactions

**Filters**:
- **Account**: See all entries for specific account
- **Property**: Filter by property
- **Date Range**: Focus on specific period

**Table Shows**:
- Date
- Account (number and name)
- Description
- Property
- Debit amount
- Credit amount

**Totals**:
- Sum of all debits
- Sum of all credits
- **MUST BALANCE** (if not, error exists)

#### Automatic Entries

System creates GL entries automatically when you:
- **Record rent payment** → Debit: Cash, Credit: Rental Income
- **Pay maintenance** → Debit: Maintenance Expense, Credit: Cash
- **Collect late fee** → Debit: Cash, Credit: Late Fee Income

#### Manual Entries

For transactions not covered by forms, use accountant to create manual journal entries.

**Best Practice**:
- **Review monthly** for accuracy
- **Verify debits = credits** always
- **Use for tax prep** (URA compliance)
- **Keep for audit trail** (ICPAU requirement)
- **Export for accountant** review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Debits and Credits Don't Balance"

**Cause**: Manual entry error or system issue
**Solution**:
1. Navigate to General Ledger
2. Check totals at bottom of table
3. If unbalanced, contact system administrator
4. Do not proceed with financial reporting until resolved

#### "Rent Reminders Not Sending"

**Cause**: SMS API not configured or no credits
**Solution**:
1. Check with system administrator
2. Verify messaging API key is set (messagingService.ts)
3. Verify SMS credits available with provider
4. For now, send reminders manually via phone

#### "Can't See Recent Payment in Reports"

**Cause**: Page not refreshed after payment entry
**Solution**:
1. Refresh browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. System calculates in real-time from General Ledger
3. If still missing after refresh, check payment was saved

#### "Occupancy Rate Incorrect"

**Cause**: Property "Occupied Units" not updated
**Solution**:
1. Navigate to Properties
2. Edit property
3. Update "Occupied Units" to match current tenants
4. System auto-calculates from this number

#### "Can't Find Deleted Item"

**Cause**: Deletion is permanent (no trash/recycle bin)
**Solution**:
- **Prevention**: System confirms before delete - read carefully
- **Recovery**: Not possible in localStorage version
- **For Production**: Implement database backups (nightly recommended)

### Data Backup

**Current System (localStorage)**:
- Data stored in browser's localStorage
- **Risk**: Browser clear/reinstall = data loss
- **Mitigation**: Regular manual backups

**Backup Process**:
1. Browser → Developer Tools (F12)
2. Application tab → Local Storage
3. Copy all data
4. Save to text file (weekly minimum)

**Production Recommendation**:
- Migrate to database backend (PostgreSQL)
